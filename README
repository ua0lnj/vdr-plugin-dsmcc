See the file COPYING for license information.

Description:

Parses UK Profile 1.05/1.06 Object Carousel and saves files to disk (all
stored under /tmp/cache at the moment). The files are the scripts and
text/image data for MHEG5, the interactive(ish) element of digital TV. At
the moment the MHEG scripts are not parsed, so to duplicate that 
interactive experience, speedy usage of "cat" and "xv" is recommended.

Alternatively, patches implementing ASN1 decoding of the scripts, a MHEG
engine (Java one already available for free) or any of the improvements
mentioned in TODO will help in providing true interactivity. (At which 
time the UK will probably switch to MHP...)

This is very alpha code, so might crash your setup a lot, please do not
enable the plugin if you need vdr to record something.
