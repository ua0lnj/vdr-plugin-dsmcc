	- Use libdsmcc to decode the transport stream.
	
	- Scanning code not tested, need to find a correct way to
	  know when complete carousel has been received.

	- Import into CVS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2003-06-27: Version 0.3

- Added some threading to receiver (doesnt work very well)
- Added autoscan when hit dsmcc menu entry
- Fixed more memory problems
- Metadata decoding support from Marc Rovira Vall

2003-05-21: Version 0.2.3

- More fixes for new carousel code.
- Started work on mapping ASN1 back to MHEG5 textual notation

2003-05-20: Version 0.2.2

- Separate carousel class to store each cache and other information. Various 
  changes to support this.

2003-05-16: Version 0.2.1

- Handles multiple carousels and streams correctly. Seperate cache per
  carousel.
- Start of new logging system
- Introduced new memory bug somewhere...

2003-04-23: Version 0.2.0

- Changed Version number =)

2003-04-23: Version 0.1.5

- Fixed infinite loop error parsing cached dirs
- Write files out if data arrived previously, then parent directory
  then FileInfo. All files should now be created in correct directory.
- Improved SI parsing for MHP from Marc.

2003-04-22: Version 0.1.4

- Save MHP AIT table to /tmp/ait.table
- Testing of MHP parsing by Marc Rovira Vall

2003-04-22: Version 0.1.3

- Improved support of MHP 
- Cache file data that arrives before file info

2003-03-25: Version 0.1.2

- Fixed memory errors in 0.1.1
- Re-attach previous arrived directory and files if arrived before parent
  directory
- Save directories and files in correct place in filesystem
- Create directory structure under /tmp/cache/{ChannelName}

2003-03-09: Version 0.1.1

- Working on supporting MHP spec

- Improved data block caching with (over)elaborate method. Now
  saves data blocks even if they arrive halfway through sequence and
  if drop a block we still save the following blocks, rather than
  abandoning the entire sequence.

2003-02-25: Version 0.1.0

- First public release.
- Fixed (3) last (hmmmm) memory errors in cache_module
- Hashed out lots of debugging code, need to make config option along
  with stats collection to show what is in the carousel.
- Fixed incorrect checking for CRC flag, had been dropping (valid) modules
- Fixed problems when data block duplicated, keep count of current block.
  (BBC carousels seem to send duplicate blocks in series for some modules?)
- Tried to cleanup code (and failed!)

2003-03-24: Version 0.0.9

- Fixed SI parsing code (problems with teletext, BBC Parliament streams)
- Fixed (last?) memory problem, program now quits without core dump!

2003-03-21: Version 0.0.8

- Added code to VDR to allow pids to be added after the cReceiver constructor
  is called, as the plugin now parses the DSI/DII messages to find which
  streams the data is transmitted on. Possibly a better way to do this ?, or
  maybe even just subscribe to all DSMCC streams ?.

2003-03-18: Version 0.0.7

- Swiped SI parsing code from Ragnar Sundblad's ttxtsubs plugin. Modifying
  to parse MHEG streams.

2003-03-12: Version 0.0.6
- Fixed all (known) memory errors. Tested with various streams, seems to
  cope. Need to improve memory freeing at end, parse PMT and connect tags
  (should be seperate from dsmcc library ?), save files under correct dir
  and improve caching. Then add some stats stuff, clean up and release. Maybe
  next week ?.

2003-03-03: Version 0.0.5

- Wiped all files by accident. Mostly recovered from version 0.0.3 and 
  by grepping through a dd'ed hard disk image.
	(Tip from OxLUG mailing list,  
		dd if=/dev/hda2 of=disk.img bs=32768
		tr -c -d '[:print:]\n' < disk.img > hda2.text
	)

2003-02-21: Version 0.0.4

- Saves files to filesystem in cache.

2003-02-21: Version 0.0.3

- Parses some of the Biop structures

2003-02-15: Version 0.0.2

- Parses some of dsmcc sections.

2003-02-12: Version 0.0.1

- rEceives dsmcc sections.
