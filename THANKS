Thanks to the following for providing very useful bits of code,

	o The code to parse the SI to extract carousel information is taken
	  from Ragnar Sundblad's ttxtsubs plugin.

	o The code to calculate the dsmcc section CRC is taken from the 
	  libdtv code by Rolf Hakenes.

	o Marc Rovira Vall for testing/improving MHP parsing
